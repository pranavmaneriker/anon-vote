## Anon-vote
#### What is it?

* A hacky piece of code I wrote for solving the problem of anonymous voting.
* The generated id + passwords should be sent to emails. Will probably add a script for it.

#### Running
* gen passwords using 
	
	```php gen_secrets.php```

* Send a mail with to each id with the secret

* Set home as test_vote.php


**This sucks, I can do much better**

I know. But it works. Under the constraints of not having access to a database and only being able to run php where it was hosted, I think it is ok.

**I have found X bug**
